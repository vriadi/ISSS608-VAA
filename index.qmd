This website serves as a digital portfolio for my coursework in the ISSS608 Visual Analytics and Applications module. Whether you're a fellow student, instructor, potential recruiter, or simply curious about data visualization with R, I hope you’ll find this space insightful and engaging.

Here, you will find a collection of my work structured into three main sections:

-   [Hands-on Exercises](Hands-on_Ex/Hands-on_Ex01/Hands-on_Ex01.html) – Guided tasks completed with practical tutorials that explore key concepts and techniques in visual analytics.
-   In-class Exercises – Guided tasks completed during class sessions.
-   Take-home Exercises – More in-depth assignments that demonstrate my understanding and application of visual storytelling and data design principles.

All visualizations are developed using R and RStudio, marking my first experience with the R language—an exciting learning journey and a new set of tools for exploring and communicating data stories.
